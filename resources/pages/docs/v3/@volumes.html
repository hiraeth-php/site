		{: .note}
		This document assumes you've installed `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package} or `hiraeth/volumes`{: .package}.  If you haven't your mileage may vary.  See the [installation docs](./installation) for more information.

		A volume is a local or remote file storage system which can be accessed and worked with using an abstracted URL via a stream wrapper.  By default, Hiraeth only comes with a single volume set up: `vol://public`.  The "public" volume maps to `storage/public`{: .folder} and is designed to allow you to easily access file storage that is available to the public via the `/storage` base URL.

		Additional volumes can be created as you wish.  Hiraeth's volumes are backed by League's [Flysystem](https://github.com/thephpleague/flysystem) library with a modified/overloaded [streamwrapper](https://github.com/twistor/flysystem-stream-wrapper) for abstraction, so there is an extensive list of supported storage mechanisms.

		## Accessing Volumes

		In principle, volumes should work as any other file location would with standard PHP file operations.  The structure of a volume path is broken down into 3 parts: `[scheme]://[volume]/[target]`.  The default `[scheme]` is `vol`, though can be modified in `config/packages/volumes.jin`{: .config}.  The `[volume]` component is derived from the name of the volume configuration file, so for example "public" volume's configuraton is in `config/volumes/public.jin`{: .config}.  Lastly, the `[target]` is the actual path to the directory or file you want to work with on that volume.

		Using cues from our [files and directories docs](./files), we can see how we might create a new file:

		```php
		$app->getFile('vol://public/test.txt', TRUE)
		```

		In addition to Hiraeth's application methods, you should be able to use standard PHP functions like `file_exists()`, `copy()`, `rename()`, `fopen()`, `file_put_contents()`, etc.

		## Adding a Volume

		To create a new volume, you will need to add a `[volume]` configuration, usually in `config/volumes/[name].jin`{: .file}.  The basic structure of this file looks something like the following:

		```toml
		[volume]

			disabled = false

			class = League\Flysystem\Adapter\Example

			[&.options]

			;    argument = value
		```

		On boot, the application provider which creates the volumes and registers them with the stream wrapper will look for configured `[volume]` instances and instantiate their configured `class` with the arguments provided under `[&.options]`.

		{: .note}
		Options for the class are named arguments.  That is to say, the key for each option must match the parameter name on the class.  These options should only contain non-object dependency information for the injector.  If your adapter requires additional object dependencies, the dependency injector will attempt to instantiate them automatically and use any [delegates](./delegates) for those classes.
