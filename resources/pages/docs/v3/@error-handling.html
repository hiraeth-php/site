		Hiraeth provides robust error handling using [SlashTrace](https://github.com/dotink/slashtrace).

		{: .note}
		Hiraeth runs in production mode by default.  This means that until you've set up debugging, logging, or additional services in your `.env`{: .config}, you won't be seeing much detail if something is going wrong.  Make sure to read the below sections carefully and choose what makes the most sense for your environment.

		## Debugging Mode {: #debugging}

		To put the application in debugging mode, modify the environment file and make sure the following is set:

		```toml
		DEBUG = true
		```

		During runtime, you can check if the application is in debugging mode by performing the following:

		```php
		if ($app->isDebugging()) {
			...
		}
		```

		When the application is in debugging mode, you will see stacktrace and related context information presented as a web request's response in the event of an error:

		![image](/images/slashtrace.png){: .w-full}

		If you're running a CLI command, trace information will be presented as standard error output in the terminal.

		## Logging {: #logging}

		You can enable logging by installing `hiraeth/monolog`{: .package} and updating your `.env`{: .config} to set `LOGGING` to the approriate log level.  Logs of the requests level or higher will then be sent to the default file location under `storage/logs`{: .folder}.

		```toml
		LOGGING = error
		```

		Supported types map to [PSR-3 LogLevel constants](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/#5-psrlogloglevel).
