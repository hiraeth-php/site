		This document assumes you've installed `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package} or `hiraeth/dbal`{: .package}.  If you haven't your mileage may vary.  See the [installation docs](./installation) for more information.


		Hiraeth's database access and datbase abstraction layer is powered by [Doctrine's DBAL library](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html).

		Connections are the starting point for database functionality, they enable you to execute queries (including prepared statements) as well as gain access to additional utilities for things like schema inflection, building queries, etc.

		Each connection is defined by a JIN configuration file containing a `[connection]` section.  For example `config/connections/default.jin`{: .config} contains the settings for the connection named `default`.  By default, this configuration will read from environment variables, so unless you have need to add an additional configuration or want to source these values elsewhere, you can simply define these settings in your `.env` file:

		```toml
		[DATABASES]

			[&.DEFAULT]

				TYPE = pdo_pgsql
				NAME = database
				USER = user
				; PASS = myP@ssW0rd
				; HOST = not.localhost.com
				; PORT = 31337
		```

		Hiraeth's DBAL integration supports mulitple connections out of the box, so the preferred way to obtain your connection is to inject the `Hiraeth\Dbal\ConnectionRegistry`{: .class}:

		```php
		use Hiraeth\Dbal\ConnectionRegistry;

		class MyService
		{
			public function __construct(ConnectionRegistry $registry)
			{
				$this->connection = $registry->getConnection('default');
			}
		}
		```

		Once you've obtained a connection, you should be able to use it in accordance with [Doctrine's documentation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/3.7/reference/data-retrieval-and-manipulation.html).  In the above example, the name is optional, but if not provided will always attempt to return the connection named `default`.

		## Adding a Connection

		Connections can be added by creating a new connection configuration in the `config/dbal` directory.  The basename of the configuration (minus the `.jin` extension) will be the name of the connection.

		The connection file itself is relatively straightforward.  Let's copy the `default.jin` called `blog.jin` and modify a few things.  We'll change our environment variable names to match our blog settings, and uncomment the password as we'll need a password to access this database.

		```toml
		[connection]
			driver = env(DATABASES_BLOG_TYPE)
			dbname = env(DATABASES_BLOG_NAME)
			user = env(DATABASES_BLOG_USER)
			password = env(DATABASES_BLOG_PASS)
		```

		Now we can add our `.env`{: .config} settings accordingly:

		```toml
		[DATABASES]

			[&.BLOG]

				TYPE = pdo_mysql
				NAME = blog
				USER = bloguser
				PASS = myS3cr3tP455werd
		```

		Finally, we can get our blog connection thusly:

		```php
		use Hiraeth\Dbal\ConnectionRegistry;

		class MyBlogService
		{
			public function __construct(ConnectionRegistry $registry)
			{
				$this->connection = $registry->getConnection('blog');
			}
		}
		```

		To enable the ORM, you'll need to add `hiraeth/doctrine` and configure the entity manager.
