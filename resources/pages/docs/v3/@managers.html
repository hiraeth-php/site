        {: .note}
        This document assumes you've installed `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package} or `hiraeth/doctrine`{: .package} and `hiraeth/cache`{: .package}.  If you haven't your mileage may vary.  See the [installation docs](./installation) for more information.

        Managers, or more fully "Entity Managers," are Doctrine's mechanism for working with model objects or "entities."  Minimally, a manager needs to know what [connection](./connections) it uses and where to find its entity classes.  The `default` manager will use the `default` connection and look for entities in `local/entities`{: .folder}.

        To change these settings (and more) you can edit `config/managers/default.jin`{: .config}.  Due to the length of this configuration, it will not be included in full, however, the basic layout looks something like the following:

        ```toml
        [manager]

            connection = default
            cache = default
            paths = ["local/entities"]
        ```

        Hiraeth's Doctrine integration supports mulitple managers out of the box, so the preferred way to obtain your manager is to inject the `Hiraeth\Doctrine\ManagerRegistry`{: .class}:

        ```php
        use Hiraeth\Doctrine\ManagerRegistry;

        class MyService
        {
            public function __construct(ManagerRegistry $registry)
            {
                $this->manager = $registry->getManager('default');
            }
        }
        ```

    {% endapply %}
{% endblock %}
