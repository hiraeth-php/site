		You can install Hiraeth with a few simple [composer](https://getcomposer.org) commands.

		## Requirements {: #requirements}

		- PHP 8.2+
		- Composer

		## Create Project {: #create-project}

		```html
		composer create-project hiraeth/app:^3.0 <path> -s dev
		cd <path>
		```

		## Installing Packages {: #packages}

		Hiraeth, itself, is just a nano framework.  But, a lot of time and energy has been put into creating packages that integrate widely used, well-tested, and feature rich PHP libraries available in the ecosystem.  To install a package is as simple as running `composer require`.  Throughout this documentation, packages required for certain functionality will be indicated by the small giftbox icon, like: `<package>`{: .package}.

		If you're looking for a turnkey framework in line with most traditional MVC frameworks, go ahead an **bootstrap** it.  From inside your app directory by requiring `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package}:

		```bash
		composer require hiraeth/bootstrap
		```

		Bootstrap provides common web application features like an HTTP entry point, middleware capabilities, routing, events, volumes, cache, CLI comamnds/shell, templating (Twig) and an ORM (Doctrine).

		### Bootstrap Requirements {: #bootstrap-requirements}

		In order to install `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package} you will need the following PHP extensions installed as these are minimal dependencies in the downstream packages:

		- PDO Sqlite3 Extension
		- BCMath Extension
		- MBString Extension
		- Curl Extension
