		## AbstractRepository

		> _NOTE: The doctrine package will alias, by default, `Hiraeth\Doctrine\AbstractRepository` as `AbstractRepository`.  In order to take full advantage of the features below, you will need to make sure your repository class(es) extend it directly, or via the alias._

		```
		class People extends \AbstractRepository
		{

		}
		```


		### Setting the Entity Class

		The first thing you want to do when you extend the `AbstractRepository` is to set the corresponding entity class:

		```
		protected static $entity = Person::class;
		```

		### Setting the Default Order

		The second thing you want to do is set the default order:

		```
		protected static $order = [
			'lastName'  => 'asc',
			'firstName' => 'asc'
		];
		```

		### Finding and Filters

		Find all records:

		```
		$names = array();

		foreach ($repository->findAll() as $person) {
			$names[] = $person->getFullName();
		}
		```

		Find a single record:

		```
		$name = $repository->find($id)->getFullName();
		```

		The `$id` parameter above can also ben an array to match other properties of the record.  So long as the result of the `find()` call is a single record this will work, so you can use unique columns or combinations of columns to alternatively identify a single record:

		```
		$name = $repository->find(['email' => $email])->getFullName();
		```

		Or `findOneBy` to find the first record.  Unlike `find` this will not throw an exception if more than one record matches, but will only return the first:

		```
		$name = $repository->findOneBy(['age' => 18])->getFullName();
		```

		You can use `findBy` to find all matching records:

		```
		$names = array();

		foreach ($repository->findBy(['age' => 18]) as $person) {
			$names[] = $person->getFullName();
		}
		```

		### Queries and Builders

		Doing complex queries will generally require you to use DQL or Doctrine's `QueryBuilder`.  We expose a simple mechanism for building queries for a given repository with the `query()` method.  Unlike `find` methods, the `query` method will return an instance of `Hiraeth\Doctrine\Collection` which contains support for some additional methods:

		```
		$adult_names = $repository->query(function($builder) {
			return $builder->where('this.age >= 18');
		})->map(function(Person $person) {
			return $person->getFullName();
		});
		```

		{: .note}
		Before passing the `QueryBuilder` to the build method(s), the builder will be initialized to select the current repository's entity class aliases as `this`.

		Alternatively to passing the `query()` method a callable, you can pass it a string corresponding to an existing `build*()` method.  For example, instead of the above we could add to our repository:

		```
		protected function buildAdults($builder)
		{
			return $builder->where('this.age >= 18');
		}
		```

		Then do the following:

		```
		$adults = $repository->query('adults');
		```

		You can do more than one by passing an array:

		```
		$tall_adults = $repository->query(['tall', 'adults']);
		```

		As long as you have the corresponding build function:

		```
		protected function buildTall($builder)
		{
			return $builder->where('this.height >= 72');
		}
		```
