		{: .note}
		This document assumes you've installed `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package} or `hiraeth/monolog`{: .package}.  If you haven't your mileage may vary.  See the [installation docs](./installation) for more information.

		Logging in Hiraeth is performed generally performed using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) which adhere's to the [PSR-3](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) FIG standard.  You can receive an instance of the logger by typehinting `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface`{: .interface}.  While this will inject the Monolog logger instance directly, it's also possible to use the `Hiraeth\Application`{: .class} instance which will proxy log related method calls to the logger, if registered, via the `log()` method.

		## Setting Log Level

		The minimum log level can be set in the `.env`{: .config} with the `LOGGING` key:

		```toml
		LOGGING = error
		```

		{: .note}
		If no `.env`{: .config} exists or if the `LOGGING` key is missing, the default log level will be `warning`.  Log level names are not case sensitive in the config, however, should represent one of the constant names on `Psr\Log\Loglevel`{: .class}.

		## Handlers

		By default, `hiraeth/monolog`{: .package} will configure a single `Monolog\Handler\RotatingFileHandler`{: .class} which writes to `storage/logs`{: .folder}.  Handlers can be modified or added in `config/loggers`{: .folder}.  The basic structure of this file is as follows:

		```toml
		[logger]

			disabled = false

			class = Acme\Logger\Handler

			[&.options]

			;    argument = value
		```

		On boot, the delegate which creates the logger will look for configured `[logger]` instances and instantiate their configured `class` with the arguments provided under `[&.options]` via [dependency injection](./dependencies).

		{: .note}
		Options for the class are named arguments.  That is to say, the key for each option must match the parameter name on the class.  These options should only contain non-object dependency information for the injector.  If your handler requires additional object dependencies, the dependency injector will attempt to instantiate them automatically and use any [delegates](./delegates) for those classes.

		## Using the Logger

		To use the logger, you can typhint either `Psr\Log\LoggerInterface`{: .interface} or `Hiraeth\Application`{: .class}.  Each log level has its own method for logging at that log level:

		```php
		$logger->error('This goes to handlers handling the error level')
		```

		### Adding Context

		You can add context to the logged error by providing an array as the second argument:

		```php
		$logger->error('Failed updating user', ['id' => $user_id])
		```
