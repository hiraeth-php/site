		## Set Up environment {: #dot-env}

		Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`{: .config}.  This provides basic environment variables which your Hireath install may need to know about.

		```bash
		cp .env.example .env
		```

		By default, you won't see any debug output if there's errors because the default configuration is to run in production (primarily for security reasons).  So if you're just messing around or working in a development environment, update the file and set `DEBUG` equal to `true`:

		```toml
		DEBUG    = true
		CACHING  = false
		LOGGING  = false
		TIMEZONE = America/Los_Angeles
		```

		Once you actually go to production you'll want to set `DEBUG` back to `false` and `CACHING` set to `true`.

		## Ensure Storage is Writable {: #permissions}

		{: .note}
		**If you're just testing things out and are running PHP's built in web server as the same user that you installed Hiraeth as, you probably don't need to worry too much about this.**  If not, the examples below are just examples and we assume you know enough about how to admin your own servers.

		Hiraeth needs a place to write files.  Since you're _probably_ running it through a web server, you'll want to make sure that your webserver can write to `storage`{: .folder} in the application root.  On Linux systems, we strongly suggest the use of ACLs.  One common way to do this is to ensure the user your server runs as (`www-data` is common) has read, write, and execute access by default (and at present).

		```bash
		setfacl -R -dm u:www-data:rwx storage
		setfacl -R -m u:www-data:rwx storage
		```

		As ACLs use the group permissions to define the maximal permissions for any users or groups in the ACL, you'll also want to make sure everything starts as group writable.

		```
		chmod -R g+w storage
		```

		For Linux or Unix-based systems that don't have this option, you may need to change the group to whatever group your system runs as:

		```bash
		chgrp -R www-data storage
		chmod -R g+w storage
		```

		In both cases, you will likely also need to tweak your `UMASK` or server configurations to ensure when new files/folders are being created, they're created with group writable permissions.

		Windows users, you're on your own.

		## Using PHP's Built In Web Server {: #server}

		Hiraeth provides a passthru call to PHP's built in web server that allows you to quickly start a local development server.  To start this local server with your application's `public`{: .folder} as the document root, simply execute (from your application root):

		```bash
		php bin/server
		```

		{: .note}
		Did you install `hiraeth/boostrap`{: .package}?  If not, you're not going to have an `public/index.php`{: .html}.  Alternatively, you can install `hiraeth/diactoros`{: .package} or anything which implicitly provides the `hiraeth/http`{: .package} implementation.  If you're trying to roll your own custom solution, check out the information about creating a [custom entry point](./entry-point).

		You can then visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to hit the `public/index.php`{: .file} entry point.  Other pages throughout this documentation will use this as a reference URL for examples.

		If you want to change the host and port which the server runs on you can modify your `.env`{: .config} and add something like:

		```toml
		[SERVER]

			HOST = myhost.local
			PORT = 3000
		```
