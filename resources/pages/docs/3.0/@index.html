        Documentation is a work in progress.  Please be patient as pages and sections continue to be added.  If there's something you would like to know in particular, please submit an issue on [the main application repo on GitHub](https://github.com/hiraeth-php/app).

        Hiraeth is a nano framework for PHP 8.2+.  It combines a novel and modular configuration system with robust dependency injection to increase the re-usability and modularity of code.

        ## What is a Nano Framework? {: #nano-framework}

        The phrase "nano framework" was chosen for Hiraeth due to the extremely limited scope of its core components.  At its core, Hiraeth is only concerned with three distinct responsibilities:

        1. Basic Application Services
        2. Dependency Injection
        3. Configuration

        Rather than re-writing or providing separately maintained libraries to perform the work of similar monolithic frameworks, Hiraeth was designed from the ground up to have existing libraries and utilities integrated with it.
