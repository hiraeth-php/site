        Providers are similar to delegates in that they peform dependency configuration on objects constructed by the dependency injector.  Where they differ is that instead of being bound to a concrete class, they are bound to interfaces.  This allows providers to operate on a number of different classes which may require a common configuration and/or setter injection.

        While a given class may only have a single delegate, it may, depending on its interfaces, run through a number of providers.

        Providers implement the `Hiraeth\Provider`{: .interface} interface which has two methods:

        | Method            | Description
        |-------------------|----------------------------
        | `getInterfaces()` | Returns an array of interface for which the provider services
        | `__invoke()`      | Handles the setup and configuration of the object


        ## Creating a Provider

        In the example below, we examine a case where any number of objects constructed by our dependency injector might implement an interface which allows for an "authorization manager" to be set on the object.  If set, this enables these objects to access authorization information to check whether or not particular actions are allowed.

        ```php
        namespace Auth;

        use Hiraeth;

        class ManagerProvider implements Hiraeth\Provider
        {
            static public function getInterfaces(): array
            {
                return [
                    ManagedInterface::class
                ];
            }

            public function __invoke(object $instance, Hiraeth\Application $app): object
            {
                $instance->setAuthManager($app->get(ManagerInterface::class));

                return $instance;
            }
        }
        ```

        {: .note}
        Hiraeth has one _special_ form of provider called an "application provider."  Application providers differ from normal providers in two ways.  The `$instance` provided is a shared application state object which can have properties assigned to it to help coordinate between multiple application providers.  The only "interface" it provides for is `Hiraeth\Application`{: .class}.  See [an example](https://github.com/hiraeth-php/monolog/blob/master/src/providers/ApplicationProvider.php) of an application provider in `hiraeth/monolog`{: .package}.

        ## Registering a Provider

        Once our class is added and our autoloader is aware of it, we can register the provider in any config file under the `[application]` section.  Hiraeth scans all `[application]` sections on startup and registers the providers as post-construction callbacks to configure the dependency.

        ```toml
        [application]

            providers = [
                "Auth\ManagerProvider"
            ]
        ```

        Now, anywhere that dependency injection is used, if the dependency implements the `Auth\ManagedInterface`{: .interface} which defines our `setAuthManager()` method, the provider will be called to inject the required object.

        {: .note}
        Providers can operate on more than a single interface or class, however, only a single provider can be registered per interface or class.  It is possible to register a delegate to construct a class and a provider to do additional setter injection or configuration.


        ## Optional Dependencies

        It is often the case that setter injected dependencies are optional and their functionality will only be used if the dependency is available.  An example of this might be PSR-3's `Psr\Log\LoggerAwareInterface`{: .interface} where your object only performs logging if the logger is set.  Using our example above, however, we can imagine that our dependency will only do authorization checks if the `Auth\ManagerInterface`{: .interface} is set.

        We can use [PSR-11 documentation](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/)'s `has()` method to determine whether or not we have a concrete instance that provides the requisite service before setting it.  We modify our provider accordingly:

        ```php

        public function __invoke(object $instance, Hiraeth\Application $app): object
        {
            if ($app->has(ManagerInterface::class)) {
                $instance->setAuthManager($app->get(ManagerInterface::class));
            }

            return $instance;
        }

        ```

        The `$app->has()` method will always return true for a class that exists because the dependency injector will try to construct it if needed.  If you pass it the name of the interface, however, it will only return true if an alias is defined.

        Using interfaces instead of concrete classes provides a lot more flexibility and maintainability to your code.  In addition to the above dependency and configuration wiring, interfaces can be used the typehint dependencies instead of concrete classes.  All you'll need to do is add an alias.
