        Hiraeth provides robust error handling using [SlashTrace](https://github.com/slashtrace/slashtrace).  In addition to providing extensive debugging information, you can add support for additional logging and external logging services such as [Sentry](https://sentry.io).

        {: .note}
        Hiraeth runs in production mode by default.  This means that until you've set up debugging, logging, or additional services in your `.env`{: .config}, you won't be seeing much detail if something is going wrong.  Make sure to read the below sections carefully and choose what makes the most sense for your environment.

        ## Debugging Mode {: #debugging}

        To put the application in debugging mode, modify the `.env` file and make sure the following is set:

        ```toml
        DEBUG = true
        ```

        You can check if the application is in debugging mode by performing the following:

        ```php
        if ($app->isDebugging()) {
            ...
        }
        ```

        When the application is in debugging mode, you will see stacktrace and related context information presented to a web request or in the cli in accordance with [SlashTrace's standard output](https://slashtrace.com/demo.php).

        ## Logging {: #logging}

        You can enable logging by installing `hiraeth/monolog`{: .package} and updating your `.env`{: .config} to set `LOGGING` to the approriate log level.

        ```toml
        LOGGING = error
        ```

        Supported types map to [PSR-3 LogLevel constants](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/#5-psrlogloglevel).

        Logs of the requests level or higher will then be sent to the default file location under `storage/logs`{: .folder}.
