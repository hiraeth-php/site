        Delegates are responsible for telling Hiraeth how to configure and create dependencies for the dependency injector.  Think of them as an isolated factory class which can use `Hiraeth\Application`{: .class} to query configuration information, retrieve related dependencies and return a working object.  The core of Hiraeth integration is performed by creating delegates and registering those delegates through the configuration.

        Delegates are always bound to a concrete class for which that delegate is responsible for _constructing_.

        Delegates implement `Hiraeth\Delegate`{: .interface} which has two methods:

        | Method         | Description
        |----------------|----------------------------
        | `getClass()`   | Returns the class name for which the delegate is responsible for constructing
        | `__invoke()`   | Handles the construction of the class and returns the instance


        ## Creating a Delegate {: #creating-delegates}

        A contrived example in which we need to build our `Bar` class with a particular setting from our configuration might look as follows:

        ```php
        namespace Acme\Foo;

        use Hiraeth;

        class BarDelegate implements Hiraeth\Delegate
        {
            static public function getClass(): string
            {
                return Bar::class
            }

            public function __invoke(Hiraeth\Application $app): object
            {
                return new Bar($app->getConfig('packages/bar', 'setting', NULL));
            }
        }
        ```

        {: .note}
        The `__invoke()` method receives the application instance which can be used to get configuration or environment information as well as to construct subsequent dependencies via `$app->get()`.  See the [PSR-11 documentation](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/) for a complete description of DI related methods.

        ## Registering a Delegate {: #registering-delegates}

        Once our class is added and our autoloader is aware of it, we can register the delegate in any config file under the `[application]` section.  Hiraeth scans all `[application]` sections on startup and registers the delegates as factories for the class they identify.

        ```toml
        [application]

            delegates = [
                "Acme\Foo\BarDelegate"
            ]
        ```

        Now, anywhere that dependency injection is used, if we were to typhint our `Bar` class, Hiraeth will use the delegate to construct and return the object as built by the delegate.

        ```php
        class MyAction
        {
            public function __construct(Bar $bar)
            {
                $this->bar = $bar;
            }
        }
        ```

        ## Singletons {: #singletons}

        If you always need the same instance of a given class, you can share the constructed instance of that class inside the delegate.  Once shared, the dependency injector will no longer construct a new instance when its injected, but will always return the previously constructed instance.  We can modify the original delegate accordingly to see how this behavior is achieved:

        ```php
        public function __invoke(Hiraeth\Application $app): object
        {
            $instance = new Bar($app->getConfig('packages/bar', 'setting', NULL));

            return $app->share($instance);
        }
        ```

        {: .note}
        Although you can also use delegates to provide dependencies and additional configuration of classes beyond their construction, if this is the _only_ type of class configuration required you can use a [provider](./providers) instead.
