        ## Register Template Paths

        In the file `config/packages/templates.jin` you can modify template paths accordingly:

        ```toml
        [templates]

        	paths = {
        		"pages": "resources/pages",
        		"layouts": "resources/layouts"
        	}
        ```

        The key is used as an alias when loading the template so that `@pages/home.html` would be expanced to `resources/pages/home.html`.  You can add as many aliases as you need, and other package can add them in their configurations by including their own `[templates]` section.


        ## Caching

        ```{% verbatim %}
        {% cache 'namespace' {ttl: 60} %}
            //
            // Some important work
            //
        {% endcache %}
        {% endverbatim %}```

    {% endmarkdown %}
{% endblock %}
