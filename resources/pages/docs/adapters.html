        Adapters are responsible for converting a route target into an executable callback.  These enable custom targets in your routing config that can resolve and return highly custom actions.  For example, you could register a `ProxyAdapter` which will match a URL target and return an action that will proxy the request to the external URL and return the response from that request.

        By default the `hiraeth/routing` package registers and enables the following adapters:

        |   Adapter        |    Description
        |------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
        | ResponseAdapter  | Handles PSR-7 Response objects as route targets
        | SignalAdapter    | Handles string callbacks e.g. `ActionClass`, `Controller::action`

        In addition to this there is a `NativeResponder`, which although registered is disabled by default.  This responder can handle native anonymous functions or any directly native `callable` type.

        Which adapter is used to convert the target into a callable action is determined by the `match()` method implemented by the adapter and is part of the `Hiraeth\Routing\AdapterInterface`.  The `match()` method takes the `Hiraeth\Routing\Resolver`, on which you can use the `getTarget()` method to get the target of the matching route.  Below is an example from the `Hiraeth\Routing\ResponseAdapter` which returns `TRUE` if the target is an instance of a PSR-7 `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`:

        ```php
        public function match(Resolver $resolver): bool
        {
            return $resolver->getTarget() instanceof Response;
        }
        ```

        The first registered adapter which returns `TRUE` from its `match()` method on the target will then be executed via `__invoke()` to convert the target into a callable action.  In the above examples, since our target is already a response object, we simply perform the following:

        ```php
        public function __invoke(Resolver $resolver): callable
        {
            return function() use ($resolver) {
                return $resolver->getTarget();
            };
        }
        ```

        ## Registering Adapters

        Adapters can be registered by creating a new file in `config/adapters`, e.g. `config/adapters/acme.jin` with an `[adapter]` section and specifying the `class` of the adapter:

        ```toml
        [adapter]

            class = Acme\Adapter\CustomAdapter
        ```

        Adapters are matched in the order of their specified `priority` in the config.  The first to match will be executed, so if you have an adapter that handles the same type of response as another, make sure the adapter with the more specific matching criteria has a lower value.

        ```toml
            priority = 10
        ```

        If you need to disable a particular conflicting adapter for some reason you can set the `disabled` option to `TRUE`:

        ```toml
            disabled = true
        ```
