        Delegates are responsible for telling Hiraeth how to configure and create dependencies for the dependency injector.  Think of them as an isolated factory class which can use `Hiraeth\Application` to query configuration information, retrieve related dependencies and return a working object.  The core of Hiraeth integration is performed by creating delegates and registering those delegates through the configuration.

        Delegates are always bound to a class for which that delegate is responsible for constructing.  If you have dependency configuration that maps to an interface (such as with setter injection) you can use a [provider](/docs/providers).

        Delegates implement the `Hiraeth\Delegate` interface which has two methods:

        | Method         | Description
        |----------------|----------------------------
        | `getClass()`   | Returns the class name for which the delegate is responsible for constructing
        | `__invoke()`   | Handles the construction of the class and returns the instance


        ## Creating a Delegate

        A contrived example in which we need to build our `Bar` class with a particular setting from our configuration might look as follows:

        ```php
        namespace Acme\Foo;

        use Hiraeth;

        class BarDelegate implements Hiraeth\Delegate
        {
            static public function getClass(): string
            {
                return Bar::class
            }

            public function __invoke(Hiraeth\Application $app): object
            {
                return new Bar($app->getConfig('packages/bar', 'setting', NULL));
            }
        }
        ```

        > NOTE: The `__invoke()` method receives the application instance which can be used to get configuration or environment information as well as to construct subsequent dependencies via the injector.

        ## Registering a Delegate

        Once our class is added and our autoloader is aware of it, we can register the delegate in any config file under the `[application]` section.  Hiraeth scans all `[application]` sections on startup and registers the delegates as factories for the class they identify.

        ```toml
        [application]

            delegates = [
                "Acme\Foo\BarDelegate"
            ]
        ```

        Now, anywhere that dependency injection is used, if we were to typhint our `Bar` class, Hiraeth will use the delegate to construct and return the object as built by the delegate.

        ```php
        class MyAction
        {
            public function __construct(Bar $bar)
            {
                $this->bar = $bar;
            }
        }
        ```

        ## Aliases

        Note that the delegates only tell Hiraeth how to construct a concrete class name (not an interface).  In order to tell Hiraeth which concrete class to use for a given interface, you will want to add an alias to the configuration:

        ```toml
        [application]

            aliases = {
                "BarInterface": "Bar"
            }
        ```

        Now, instead of typhinting the concrete class, we can typehing the interface.  Hiraeth will recognize that the interface should be fulfilled by `Bar` and then look up the delegate responsible for constructing `Bar` to get the instance:

        ```php
        class MyAction
        {
            public function __construct(BarInterface $bar)
            {
                $this->bar = $bar;
            }
        }
        ```

        ### Pseudo-Interfaces and Class Aliases

        If you register an alias from a non-existent interface or class name, Hiraeth will register a PHP class alias and add that alias to the dependency injector.  This can be useful in cases where you might want to offer an existing concrete implementation and migrate to an actual interface later, or to allow simple aliases that can be overloaded by concrete implementations.

        For example, the `hiraeth/actions` package registers an alias of `AbstractAction`:

        ```toml
        aliases = {
    		"AbstractAction": "Hiraeth\Actions\AbstractAction"
    	}
        ```

        This allows any actions you create to simply extend `\AbstractAction` rather than the full class name.  Additionally, since the alias won't be registered if the interface or class already exists, you can add your own real `AbstractAction` class which extends the `Hiraeth\Actions\AbstractAction` class.  Once added, any actions which previously extended the alias will not extend your actual class implementation.

        ## Singletons

        If you always need the same instance of a given class, you can share the constructed instance of that class inside the delegate.  Once shared, the broker will no longer configure a new instance, but will always return the previously constructed instance.  We can modify the original delegate accordingly to see how this behavior is achieved:

        ```php
        public function __invoke(Hiraeth\Application $app): object
        {
            $instance = new Bar($app->getConfig('packages/bar', 'setting', NULL));

            return $app->share($instance);
        }
        ```
