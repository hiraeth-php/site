        ## Debugging Mode

        To put the application in debugging mode, modify the `.env` file and make sure the following is set:

        ```toml
        DEBUG = true
        ```

        ## Production Mode

        When the application is not in debugging mode, the production handler will exit with a 500 status (HTTP) or the exception/error code (CLI) and output will be suppressed.  You can enable logging in the `.env` file to have errors outputted to the configured loggers:

        ```toml
        LOGGING = true
        ```

        ## Sentry Support

        You can install the `hiraeth/sentry` package to enable support for sentry:

        ```bash
        composer require hiraeth/sentry
        ```

        Once installed, you will need to register the handler in any environment that should use it.  In the `.env` file, add the following information:

        ```toml
        HANDLERS = [
        	"SlashTrace\Sentry\SentryHandler"
        ]

        [SENTRY]

        	DSN = <your sentry dsn>
        ```
