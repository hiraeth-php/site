        Hiraeth's bootstrap database functionality is powered by [doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/).  Doctrine provides powerful database abstraction and a data-mapper ORM with a clean separation of concerns.

        To begin working with databases, you will need to add your settings to your `.env` file:

        ```toml
        [DATABASES]

        	[&.DEFAULT]

        		TYPE = pdo_pgsql
        		NAME = database
        		USER = user
                PASS = password
                HOST = 127.0.0.1
                PORT = 5432
        ```

        Note, that by default `HOST`, `PASS`, and `PORT` are disabled in the connection configuration itself, located at `config/dbal/default.jin`.  You will want to uncomment these settings to pull the values from the `.env` file if you need password based login or to modify the default host `127.0.0.1` or the default port (which will default to the appropriate default port based on your database type).
