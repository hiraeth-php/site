        ## AbstractRepository

        > _NOTE: The doctrine package will alias, by default, `Hiraeth\Doctrine\AbstractRepository` as `AbstractRepository`.  In order to take full advantage of the features below, you will need to make sure your repository class(es) extend it directly, or via the alias._

        ### Setting the Entity Class

        The first thing you want to do when you extend the `AbstractRepository` is to set the corresponding entity class:

        ```
        protected static $entity = Person::class;
        ```

        ### Setting the Default Order

        The second thing you want to do is set the default order:

        ```
        protected static $order = [
            'lastName'  => 'asc',
            'firstName' => 'asc'
        ];
        ```

        ### Collections vs. Arrays

        Doctrine's standard `findBy`, `findAll` and similar methods which traditionally return arrays will return instances of `Hiraeth\Doctrine\Collection` which extends the standard doctrine `ArrayCollection`.  This allows you to go from query to PHP in one seamless/fluid method chain:

        ```
        $names = $repository->findAll()->map(function($person) {
            return $person->getFullName();
        });
        ```

        If you need to get an array to use with PHP's native array functions or to pass to a function that only supports arrays you can use the `toArray()` method:

        ```
        $names->toArray()
        ```

        ### Queries and Builders

        Doing complex queries will generally require you to use DQL or Doctrine's `QueryBuilder`.  We expose a simple mechanism for building queries for a given repository with the `query()` method:

        ```
        $adults = $repository->query(function($builder) {
            return $builder->where('this.age >= 18');
        });
        ```

        > _NOTE: Before passing the `QueryBuilder` to the build method(s), the builder will be initialized to select the current repository's entity class aliases as `this`.

        Alternatively to passing the `query()` method a callable, you can pass it a string corresponding to an existing `build*()` method.  For example, instead of the above we could add to our repository:

        ```
        protected function buildAdults($builder)
        {
            return $builder->where('this.age >= 18');
        }
        ```

        Then do the following:

        ```
        $adults = $repository->query('adults');
        ```

        You can do more than one by passing an array:

        ```
        $tall_adults = $repository->query(['tall', 'adults']);
        ```

        As long as you have the corresponding build function:

        ```
        protected function buildTall($builder)
        {
            return $builder->where('this.height >= 72');
        }
        ```

        Want auto-complete?  Add some constants:

        ```
        const QUERY_ADULTS = 'adults';
        const QUERY_TALL   = 'tall';
        ```
