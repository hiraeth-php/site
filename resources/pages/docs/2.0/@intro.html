        Hiraeth is a nano framework for PHP 7.2+.  It combines a novel and modular configuration system with advanced dependency injection to increase the re-usability and modularity of code.

        ## What is a Nano Framework?

        The phrase "nano framework" was chosen for Hiraeth due to the extremely limited scope of its core components.  At its core, Hiraeth is only concerned with three distinct responsibilities:

        1. Basic Application Services
        2. Dependency Injection
        3. Configuration

        Rather than re-writing or providing separately maintained libraries to perform the work of similar monolithic frameworks, Hiraeth is designed to have existing libraries and utilities integrated with it.
