        {: .note}
        This document assumes you've installed `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package} or `hiraeth/dbal`{: .package}.  If you haven't your mileage may vary.  See the [installation docs](./installation) for more information.


        Hiraeth's database access and datbase abstraction layer is powered by [Doctrine's DBAL library](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/dbal.html).

        Connections are the starting point for database functionality, they enable you to execute queries (including prepared statements) as well as gain access to additional utilities for things like schema inflection, building queries, etc.

        Each connection is defined by a JIN configuration file containing a `[connection]` section.  For example `config/connections/default.jin`{: .config} contains the settings for the connection named `default`:

        ```toml
        [connection]
        	driver = env(DATABASES_DEFAULT_TYPE)
        	user = env(DATABASES_DEFAULT_USER)
        	; password = env(DATABASES_DEFAULT_PASS)
        	; host = env(DATABASES_DEFAULT_HOST)
        	; port = env(DATABASES_DEFAULT_PORT)
        	dbname = env(DATABASES_DEFAULT_NAME)
        ```

        Uncomment the `password`, `host`, and `port` settings if you need to modify these.  Or add [additional configuration settings corresponding to doctrine's DBAL configuration](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/2.9/reference/configuration.html#connection-details).  Since we are using the `env()` function to get the actual values, we will also need to modify our `.env`{: .config} to add the actual values:

        ```toml
        [DATABASES]

            [&.DEFAULT]

                TYPE = pdo_pgsql
                NAME = database
                USER = user
        ```

        Hiraeth's DBAL integration supports mulitple connections out of the box, so the preferred way to obtain your connection is to inject the `Hiraeth\Dbal\ConnectionRegistry`{: .class}:

        ```php
        use Hiraeth\Dbal\ConnectionRegistry;

        class MyService
        {
            public function __construct(ConnectionRegistry $registry)
            {
                $this->connection = $registry->getConnection('default');
            }
        }
        ```

        Once you've obtained a connection, you should be able to use it in accordance with [Doctrine's documentation](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/2.9/reference/data-retrieval-and-manipulation.html).  In the above example, the name is optional, but if not provided will always attempt to return the connection named `default`.

        ## Adding a Connection

        Connections can be added by creating a new connection configuration in the `config/dbal` directory.  The basename of the configuration (minus the `.jin` extension) will be the name of the connection.

        The connection file itself is relatively straightforward.  Let's copy the `default.jin` called `blog.jin` and modify a few things.  We'll change our environment variable names to match our blog settings, and uncomment the password as we'll need a password to access this database.

        ```toml
        [connection]
        	driver = env(DATABASES_BLOG_TYPE)
            dbname = env(DATABASES_BLOG_NAME)
        	user = env(DATABASES_BLOG_USER)
        	password = env(DATABASES_BLOG_PASS)
        ```

        Now we can add our `.env`{: .config} settings accordingly:

        ```toml
        [DATABASES]

        	[&.BLOG]

        		TYPE = pdo_mysql
        		NAME = blog
        		USER = bloguser
        		PASS = myS3cr3tP455werd
        ```

        Finally, we can get our blog connection thusly:

        ```php
        use Hiraeth\Dbal\ConnectionRegistry;

        class MyBlogService
        {
            public function __construct(ConnectionRegistry $registry)
            {
                $this->connection = $registry->getConnection('blog');
            }
        }
        ```

        To enable the ORM, you'll need to add `hiraeth/doctrine` and configure the entity manager.
