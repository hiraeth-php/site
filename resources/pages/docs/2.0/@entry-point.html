        When accessing Hiraeth over HTTP (any standard web server), you will be hitting the application through the `public/index.php`{: .html} file.  This file is provided by `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package}, though more specifically through `hiraeth/http`{: .package}.  If you've not installed these packages or are integrating your own libraries, you can create your own custom entry point.

        We'll deconstruct the entry point for `hiraeth/http`{: .package} to get a better idea of the steps involved.

        ## Finding the Application Root

        In order to boot `Hiraeth\Application`{: .class} we'll need to know what our application root is.  The way this is achieved in default Hiraeth entry points is by simply tracking back through parent directories until we find our `composer.json`{: .config}.

        ```php
        for (
        	$root_path  = __DIR__;
        	$root_path != '/' && !is_file($root_path . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'composer.json');
        	$root_path  = realpath($root_path . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . '..')
        );
        ```

        The above allows the entry point to be moved into any sub-directory of the application root and still function as expected without having to change a static or relative root path.

        ## Get Autoloader and Application

        Once we know our application root, we can load composer's autoloader and get our application instance:

        ```php
        $loader  = require $root_path . '/vendor/autoload.php';
        $hiraeth = new Hiraeth\Application($root_path);
        ```

        {: .note}
        In addition to the `$root_path` you can also specify an environment file path and a release file path as the second and third argument respectively.


        ## Execute Hiraeth

        Finally, once we have our application instance, we can execute Hiraeth:

        ```php
        $hiraeth->exec(function() {
            //
            // Do application stuff
            //
        });
        ```

        The `$hiraeth->exec()` method will return whatever value is returned from the callback passed, so for console based entry points you may want to wrap it in an `exit()` in order to exit with the return code.  Within the context of the callback, `$this` refers to the application instance itself.  Additionally dependencies can be [dependency injected](./dependencies) by typehinting them as arguments to the callback.
