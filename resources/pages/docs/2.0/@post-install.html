        ## Set Up environment {: #dot-env}

        Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`{: .config}.  This provides basic environment variables which your Hireath install may need to know about.

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

        ## Ensure Storage is Writable {: #permissions}

        {: .note}
        **If you're just testing things out and are running PHP's built in web server as the same user that you installed Hiraeth as, you probably don't need to worry too much about this.**  If not, the examples below are just examples and we assume you know enough about how to admin your own servers.

        Hiraeth needs a place to write files.  Since you're _probably_ running it through a web server, you'll want to make sure that your webserver can write to `storage`{: .folder} in the application root.  On Linux systems, we strongly suggest the use of ACLs:

        ```bash
        setfacl -R -dm u:www-data:rwx storage
        setfacl -R -m u:www-data:rwx storage
        chmod -R g+w storage
        ```

        For Linux or Unix-based systems that don't have this option, you may need to change the group:

        ```bash
        chgrp -R www-data storage
        chmod -R g+w storage
        ```

        Windows users, you're on your own.

        ## Using PHP's Built In Web Server {: #server}

        Hiraeth provides a passthru call to PHP's built in web server that allows you to quickly start a local development server.  To start this local server with your application's `public`{: .folder} as the document root, simply execute (from your application root):

        ```bash
        php bin/server
        ```

        {: .note}
        Did you install `hiraeth/boostrap`{: .package}?  If not, you're not going to have an `public/index.php`{: .html}.  You'll need to write a [custom entry point](./entry-point).

        You can then visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to hit the `public/index.php`{: .html} entry point.  Other pages throughout this documentation will use this as a reference URL for examples.

        If you want to change the host and port which the server runs on you can modify your `.env`{: .config} and add something like:

        ```toml
        [SERVER]

            HOST = myhost.local
            PORT = 3000
        ```
