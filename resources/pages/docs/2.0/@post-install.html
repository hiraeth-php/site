        Below you will find the most common post-installation tasks.  Not all of these may be required depending on how you're using Hiraeth, but they're good to know how to do if need be anyway.

        ## Ensure Storage is Writable

        Ensure that storage and all child directories are writable by your web server and/or the accounts you will be executing the application as.  On Linux systems, we strongly suggest the use of ACLs which might look something like this:

        ```bash
        setfacl -R -dm u:www-data:rwx storage
        setfacl -R -m u:www-data:rwx storage
        chmod -R g+w storage
        ```

        ## Set Up environment

        Copy the `.env.example` to `.env`.

        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```

        > NOTE: Until your `.env` file is copied, your application will be running in debugging mode.  Once you do, the default value for `DEBUG` will be set to `false`.  If you want to re-enable debugging mode see the docs on [error handling](./error-handling).
