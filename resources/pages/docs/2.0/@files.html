        The default directory structure of `hiraeth/app`{: .package} looks like the following:

        | Directory      | Description
        |----------------|------------------------------
        | bin            | Contains PHP scripts designed to be executed via CLI, e.g. `php bin/server`
        | config         | Contains all Hiraeth configuration information
        | local          | Contains end-user PHP source code: classes, interfaces, traits, etc
        | public         | Contains web-accessible files/directories (the "document root" for your server)
        | resources      | Contains end-user templates and layouts, suggested path also for css/js source
        | storage        | Contains application writable files and folders (user uploads, logs, cache)
        | vendor         | Contains vendor PHP source code: classes, interface, traits, etc

        The parent directory of these is referred to as the "application root."

        ## Checking for a File or Directory {: #checking-files}

        You can check if a file exists using the `hasFile()` method.  For example, to see if there is a `.env` file in the application root, you can do:

        ```php
        $app->hasFile('.env')
        ```

        Similarly, you can check for directories using `hasDirectory()`.  See if a cache directory exists:

        ```php
        $app->hasDirectory('storage/cache')
        ```

        {: .note}
        File and directory names beginning with a `/` or `<scheme>://` are considered absolute.  If the path does not begin with one of these, it will be treated as relative to the application root.


        ## Getting File or Directory Information {: #getting-files}

        To get an `SplFileInfo` object for a file or directory use the `getFile()` and `getDirectory()` methods with the application root relative path:

        ```php
        $app->getFile('composer.json')
        ```

        You can then use the `SplFileInfo` object to get more information about the file or directory.  For example, to get the real absolute path to the public storage directory:

        ```php
        $app->getDirectory('storage/public')->getRealPath()
        ```

        ## Creating a File or Directory {: #creating-files}

        In many cases you may want to create a file or directory if it does not exist.  This is frequently the case, for example, if you're using `getDirectory()` to get sub-directories for storing various assets.  Adding, `TRUE` as the second argument to either `getFile()` or `getDirectory()` will attempt to create the file or directory if it does not exist.

        ```php
        $app->getFile('storage/sync.lock', TRUE)->openFile('w')->fwrite('1')
        ```
