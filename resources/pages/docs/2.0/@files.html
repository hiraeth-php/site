        The default directory structure of `hiraeth/app`{: .package} looks like the following:

        | Directory      | Description
        |----------------|------------------------------
        | bin            | Contains PHP scripts designed to be executed via CLI, e.g. `php bin/server`
        | config         | Contains all Hiraeth configuration information
        | local          | Contains end-user PHP source code: classes, interfaces, traits, etc
        | public         | Contains web-accessible files/directories (the "document root" for your server)
        | resources      | Contains end-user templates and layouts, suggested path also for css/js source
        | storage        | Contains application writable files and folders (user uploads, logs, cache)
        | vendor         | Contains vendor PHP source code: classes, interface, traits, etc

        The parent directory of these is referred to as the "application root."

        ## Checking for a File or Directory {: #checking-files}

        You can check if a file exists using the `hasFile()` method.  For example, to see if there is a `.env` file in the application root, you can do:

        ```php
        $app->hasFile('.env')
        ```

        Similarly, you can check for directories using `hasDirectory()`.  See if a cache directory exists:

        ```php
        $app->hasDirectory('storage/cache')
        ```

        {: .note}
        File and directory names beginning with a `/` or `<scheme>://` are considered absolute.  If the path does not begin with one of these, it will be treated as relative to the application root.


        ## Getting File or Directory Information {: #getting-files}

        To get an `SplFileInfo` object for a file or directory use the `getFile()` and `getDirectory()` methods with the application root relative path:

        ```php
        $app->getFile('composer.json')
        ```

        You can then use the `SplFileInfo` object to get more information about the file or directory.  For example, to get the real absolute path to the public storage directory:

        ```php
        $app->getDirectory('storage/public')->getRealPath()
        ```

        ## Creating a File or Directory {: #creating-files}

        In many cases you may want to create a file or directory if it does not exist.  This is frequently the case, for example, if you're using `getDirectory()` to get sub-directories for storing various assets.  Adding, `TRUE` as the second argument to either `getFile()` or `getDirectory()` will attempt to create the file or directory if it does not exist.

        ```php
        $app->getFile('storage/sync.lock', TRUE)
        ```

        When files are created, they will be created using the `UMASK` set in the `.env`{: .config} file.  By default, this value is `0002` which means owner and group will be able to write (this allows ACLs to limit permissions on group).  You can change this value to modify the umask for all application created files and directories.

        ```toml
        UMASK = 0022
        ```

        In addition to basic file access via `Hiraeth\Application`{: .class}, you can install `hiraeth\volumes`{: .package} to provide access to external storage interfaces like S3, SFTP, and additional local volumes.
