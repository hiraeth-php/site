        You can install Hiraeth with a few simple [composer](https://getcomposer.org) commands.

        ## Requirements {: #requirements}

        - PHP 7.2+
        - Composer

        ## Create Project {: #create-project}

        ```bash
        composer create-project hiraeth/app
        ```

        Hiraeth, itself, is just a nano framework.  But, a lot of time and energy has been put into creating packages that integrate widely used, well-tested, and feature rich PHP libraries available in the ecosystem.  If you're looking for a turnkey framework with lots of bells and whistles, go ahead an **bootstrap** it:

        ```bash
        composer require hiraeth/bootstrap
        ```

        ### Bootstrap Requirements {: #bootstrap}

        In order to install `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package} you will need the following additional dependencies:

        - PDO Sqlite Extension
        - MBString Extension
        - Curl Extension
