        {: .note}
        This document assumes you've installed `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package} or a combination of `hiraeth/diactoros`{: .package} and `hiraeth/middleland`{: .package}.  If you haven't your mileage may vary.  See the [installation docs](./installation) for more information.

        Hiraeth supports PSR-15 middleware implementing `Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface`{: .interface}.  In addition to being able to add middleware from third-party sources, a handful of middleware are installed/provided in `hiraeth/bootstrap`{: .package} out of the box:

        | Middleware         | Description
        |--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------
        | client-ip          | Provides accurate client IP as a Request attribute (`client-ip`)
        | csrf-token         | Validates `csrf::token` input field
        | encrypt-cookies    | Encrypts cookies for added security
        | firewall           | A simple IP based firewall
        | routing            | Resolves and executes routes
        | session            | Activates the user session and handles response cookies
        | templates          | Renders templates directly (no routing / action) based URL path

        ## Creating a Middleware

        Middleware needs to implement the `Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface`

        ```php
        namespace Acme\Middleware;

        use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
        use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;

        use Psr\Http\Server\MiddlewareInterface as Middleware;
        use Psr\Http\Server\RequestHandlerInterface as Handler;

        class Foo implements Middleware
        {
            public function process(Request $request, Handler $handler): Response
            {
                //
                // Modify request or return response early.
                //

                $response = $handler->handle($request);

                //
                // Modify the response
                //

                return $response;
            }
        }
        ```

        ### Dependency Injection

        Middleware classes will be constructed via Hiraeth's dependency injector and will therefore be automatically and recursively injected with simple dependencies and dependencies for which there are already delegates/providers registered.


        ```php
        public function __construct(Acme\Foo\Service $service)
        {
            $this->service = $service;
        }
        ```


        If your middleware has complex dependencies or additional configuration options, you may want to write a [delegate](./delegates) or [provider](./providers) to handle its construction and/or configuration.


        ## Registering Middleware

        Middleware can be registered by adding a new configuration file in `config/middleware` folder.  The only required property is the class name.  In this example, we'll create `config/middleware/foo.jin`:

        ```toml
        [middleware]
            ;
            ; The middleware class to register
            ;

            class = Acme\Middleware\Foo
        ```

        ## Priorities

        Since middlewares are registered in separate configuration files, they should have an explicit priority set if they need to occur at a specific point in the stack.:

        ```toml
        [middleware]
            ;
            ; Where in the stack should this be run? Lower priority is first in,
            ; last out.
            ;

            priority = 22

            ;
            ; The middleware class to register
            ;

            class = Acme\Middleware\Foo
        ```

        > NOTE: The default priority is **50** and the maximum used by official packages is **100** (the router).

        If you are releasing a package that integrates with Hiraeth, it is suggested you use the following reference to determine an appropriate priority for your middleware.  End-users can use this as a reference to get an idea where they may wish to place their own middleware with respect to others.


        | Priority | Description
        |----------|---------------------------
        | 0 - 10   | Error / exception handling middleware, request normalization, session handling.
        | 11 - 20  | Reserved for end-users.
        | 21 - 30  | Early returners like redirectors, IP based firewalls, etc.
        | 41 - 50  | Reserved for end-users.
        | 51 - 60  | Authentication, content security, etc.
        | 61 - 70  | Reserved for end-users.
        | 71 - 80  | Content modifiers, compression, etc.
        | 81 - 90  | Reserved for end-users.
        | 91 - 99  | Content response handlers


        ## Disabling Middleware

        If you need to disable a middleware quickly, then the easiest way is simply to add a `disabled` property to the configuration and set the value to `TRUE`.

        ```toml
        [middleware]

            ;
            ; Whether or not this middleware is disabled
            ;

            disabled = true

            ;
            ; Where in the stack should this be run? Lower priority is first in,
            ; last out.
            ;

            priority = 22

            ;
            ; The middleware class to register
            ;

            class = Acme\Middleware\Foo
        ```
