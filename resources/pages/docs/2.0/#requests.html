        Hiraeth uses a combination of PSR-7 / PSR-15 compatible components for handling web requests.  The official PSR-7 library used by Hiraeth's bootstrap is Zend's [diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros).

        Without going into complete detail, we'll cover some of the basics here, however, to understand the full scope of PSR-7 requests you should look at the [documentation](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/), in particular, the `ServerRequestInterface`.

        ## Obtaining a Request

        Depending on the context the server request can be obtained in different ways.  Since these objects are immutable by default, the request you obtain may be modified from the original.  The three primary contexts in which you will acquire a request are as follows:

        - Middleware
        - Actions

        ### Middleware

        In the case of middleware, the current request is passed as the first argument, however, it may have been modified by previous middlewares.  See [the PSR-15 documentation](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/#22-psrhttpservermiddlewareinterface) for more details.

        ### Actions

        For classes that extend `Hiraeth\Actions\AbstractAction` (part of the `hireath/actions` package), you can access the `request` property on the object instance:

        ```php
        class ViewHome extends AbstractAction
        {
            public function __invoke()
            {
                if ($this->request->getMethod() == 'POST') {
                    return 'Hello Postman!';
                }

                return 'Hello World!';
            }
        }
        ```

        ### Other Contexts

        If you need the request in another context, the best way is to have it set on your class or passed in as an argument from a Middleware or Action.  Post-routing, however, it is possible to obtain the request at the time of route resolution by injecting the `Hiraeth\Routing\Resolver` by typehinting its interface (`Hiraeth\Routing\ResolverInterface`) or by creating a provider.

        Once you have the resolver injected, simply use:

        ```php
        $resolver->getRequest()
        ```

        ## Basic Request Usage

        Get the URI for the request.  Additional details like the domain, path, etc, are available on the URI object.

        ```php
        $request->getUri()
        ```

        Get the HTTP method used to make the request.

        ```php
        $request->getMethod()
        ```

        Get query parameters:

        ```php
        $request->getQueryParams()
        ```

        Get parsed body (for POST data):

        ```php
        $request->getParsedBody()
        ```
