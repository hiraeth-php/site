        Hiraeth's bootstrap template engine is [twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) which provides extremely robust templating as well as extensibility.

        ## Register Template Paths

        In the file `config/packages/templates.jin` you can modify template paths accordingly:

        ```toml
        [templates]

        	paths = {
        		"pages": "resources/pages",
        		"layouts": "resources/layouts"
        	}
        ```

        The key is used as an alias when loading the template so that `@pages/home.html` would be expanced to `resources/pages/home.html`.  You can add as many aliases as you need, and other package can add them in their configurations by including their own `[templates]` section.

        ### Multiple Template Roots

        You can add additional roots for templates as fallbacks -- this allows you to do easy template overloading by simply converting the values to an array with the paths in order in which the templating engine should look:

        ```toml
        [templates]

        	paths = {
        		"pages": [
                    "resources/pages",
                    "vendor/acme/foo/resources/pages"
                ],
        		"layouts": [
                    "resources/layouts",
                    "vendor/acme/foo/resources/layouts"
                ]
        	}
        ```

        ## Caching

        ```{% verbatim %}
        {% cache 'namespace' {ttl: 60} %}
            //
            // Some important work
            //
        {% endcache %}
        {% endverbatim %}```

    {% endapply %}
{% endblock %}
